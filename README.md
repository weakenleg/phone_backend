# phone_backend
https://phonebook-backend2-lhlb.onrender.com/ is depolyed link. Please start the backend at first and then test it.
The main change for fronted is the url, and some corresponding change to backend.
Due to the MongoDB, it will generate _id, it may lead to some bugs. I fix some, and it may be some potential bugs, which I did
not fix.
